# Rock, Paper, and Scissors Image Classifier
This is a final project for Dicoding that I worked on independently. This project is a part of the requirements for graduating from the Machine Learning Developer class that I attended. The dataset used was obtained from the Dicoding platform.

3. Expected Outcomes

### 1. Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. Gather and preprocess a comprehensive dataset of hand images representing rock, paper, and scissors gestures, ensuring a diverse range of hand shapes, sizes, and skin tones.
2. Design and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) tailored for image classification to accurately distinguish between the three hand image categories.
3. Assess the model's accuracy and performance using a dedicated validation dataset, employing metrics of accuracy and loss on both training and validation data.

### 2. Methodology
- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Model Development
- Model Evaluation

### 3. Expected Outcomes
An image classification model that can accurately distinguish 3 categories of images: rock, paper, and scissors.


## Conclusion
From this **rock-paper-scissors image classification** project, I gained a deeper understanding of machine learning, image processing, and techniques related to classification tasks
